# Face-Recognition-Attendance-System
An automated system that uses facial recognition technology to accurately identify and record attendance of students in a university.
The system employs face detection algorithm KNN to locate and detect faces in real time. 
As the faculty hovers the camera over the classroom, the attendance for all the students present in the classroom gets marked as present and also gets updated in the universityâ€™s learning management system simultaneously.
Tech stack: Python- OpenCV, Face Recognition, MySQL Database, Flask Web Framework
